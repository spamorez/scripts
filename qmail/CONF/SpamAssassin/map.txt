# Sample DCC client information
#   See cdcc(8) about loading this file into the memory mapped client file,
#   /var/dcc/map, with the "load" command.  When used for that purpose,
#   it must not be publicly readable.

#   This file is otherwise only documentation for the mapped client file.
#   It is handy to regularly update it with a command like
#	`cdcc info > map.txt` and archive it with RCS or SCCS.
#   Note that command must be run as the dcc user or the passwords will not be
#   captured.
